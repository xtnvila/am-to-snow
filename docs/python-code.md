# Python Code Documentation

This implements a simple Flask application that receives alerts from an alert manager, and creates corresponding incidents in ServiceNow. 

The application exposes a `/alerts` endpoint that accepts POST requests containing alerts in JSON format. For each alert, it will create a new incident in ServiceNow using the REST API.

# Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `SERVICENOW_INSTANCE_URL`: The base URL of the ServiceNow instance API.
- `SERVICE_NOW_USERNAME`: Username to authenticate to ServiceNow.
- `SERVICE_NOW_PASSWORD`: Password for the ServiceNow user.

These should be set appropriately with the details of your ServiceNow instance.

# endpoints

## POST /alerts

Accepts a JSON payload containing a list of alerts from the alert manager. Each alert should have:

- `labels` - A map of labels including the `alertname`
- `annotations` - A map of annotations including a `description` 

For each alert, it will create a new ServiceNow incident using the `short_description` from the alert name label, and `description` from the annotation.

The response code indicates success or failure creating the incidents.

# Implementation

- `create_service_now_incident()` makes the ServiceNow API call to create the incident for a given alert.
- The `/alerts` endpoint handler loops through the alerts and calls this function.
- The ServiceNow API is called using the `requests` library.
- Authentication uses the configured username/password.
